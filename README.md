### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Principal Software Developer generally working using the latest technologies, especially the ones related to Cloud Computing and Web Development. I love challenges and working with new technology, as well as sharing my knowledge, mentoring, and helping others to grow. That's why I love being part of several developer communities in Buenos Aires, Argentina as well as many conferences in LATAM, both as speaker and organizer. Additionally, because of that, I was awarded as [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-nicol_C3_A1s_bello_camilletti), and [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5001738) (Most Valuable Professional). I also have an engineering degree in Software and a bachelor's degree in Computer Systems, both from the University of Buenos Aires.
