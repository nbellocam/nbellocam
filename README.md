### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Head of Engineering at [@qurable](https://github.com/qurable), leading a distributed team on a SaaS platform for the next generation of loyalty programs built on the fundamentals of the web3.

I'm a Google Developer Expert and Google for Startups Accelerator Mentor ([profile](https://developers.google.com/profile/u/nbellocam)), and also a [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5001738) (Most Valuable Professional) for more than 7 years.

I love discussing and teaching about emerging technologies, and I'm passionate for Cloud Computing, DevOps and Web Development. That's why I participate in several developer communities in Buenos Aires, Argentina as well as various conferences in Latam.

I have a software engineering degree and a bachelor's degree in Computer Systems both from the University of Buenos Aires.
